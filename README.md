# Direct MaxFlux method

## Overview

This package provides a Python implementation of the direct MaxFlux (DMF) method and the flat-bottom elastic network model (FB-ENM). These tools offer a variational framework for reaction-path optimization and an efficient approach to generating physically plausible initial paths.

The software is intended for researchers who use ASE-compatible calculators and require either a method for obtaining near–transition-state structures without relying on second or higher energy derivatives, or a method for interpolating between two structures in a chemically plausible manner.

 - Compared with existing double-ended reaction-path optimization methods (e.g., NEB), DMF improves computational efficiency in terms of both the number of energy-evaluation points along the path and the number of optimization iterations.

 - Compared with existing initial-path generation approaches (e.g., IDPP), FB-ENM provides more energetically preferable paths with improved robustness.


## Requirements

- [ASE](https://ase-lib.org/)
- [cyipopt](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)


## Installation

We generally recommend installing this package via **conda**, as `cyipopt` is most reliably installed through conda.

```bash
conda create -n dmf python=3.10
conda activate dmf
conda install -c conda-forge ase cyipopt
pip install git+https://github.com/shin1koda/dmf.git
```

If you prefer to install `cyipopt` without using conda, please follow its [official installation guide](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).
**After installing cyipopt**, you can install `dmf` via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/shin1koda/dmf.git
```


## Example usage

`dmf` is used as part of an ASE script. For the basics of ASE, please refer to its [official documentation](https://ase-lib.org/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.html).
An example script is provided in `sample/sample.py`:

```python
import numpy as np
from ase.io import write, read
from ase.calculators.emt import EMT
from dmf import DirectMaxFlux, interpolate_fbenm

# read react.xyz and prod.xyz
ref_images = [read('react.xyz'), read('prod.xyz')]

# generate initial path by FB-ENM
mxflx_fbenm = interpolate_fbenm(ref_images,correlated=True)

# write initial path and its coefficients
write('sample_ini.traj',mxflx_fbenm.images)
coefs = mxflx_fbenm.coefs.copy()
np.save('sample_ini_coefs',coefs)

# set up a variational problem of the direct MaxFlux method
mxflx = DirectMaxFlux(ref_images,coefs=coefs,nmove=3,update_teval=True)

# set up calculators
for image in mxflx.images:
    image.calc = EMT()

# solve the variational problem
mxflx.add_ipopt_options({'output_file':'sample_ipopt.out'})
mxflx.solve(tol='middle')

# write final path and history of x(tmax)
write('sample_fin.traj',mxflx.images)
write('sample_tmax.traj',mxflx.history.images_tmax)
```

You can run it simply by:

```bash
cd sample
python sample.py
```

Running the script produces several output files, including:

 - `sample_ini.traj`: FB-ENM–interpolated path written in ASE trajectory format
 - `sample_fin.traj`: Optimized reaction path using the EMT potential
 - `sample_tmax.traj`: History of the estimated highest-energy point during optimization
